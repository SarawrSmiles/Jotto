            <p>The object of the game is to guess the computer's secret word.</p>
            <p>The secret word is 5 letters and each letter is unique.</p>
            <p>Start by guessing any 5 letter word.</p>
            <p>The computer will score your word based on how many letters your word has in common with the secret word. i.e. secret word: shore, your word: hello, score: 3, The 2 words share 3 letters, 'h', 'e', and 'o'.</p>
            <p>You may guess as many times as you like until you discover the secret word. (Anagrams of the secret word are counted as correct as long as they are valid words.)</p>
            <p>To make things easier, each letter can be clicked to toggle between 3 different colors. It is recommended to set a letter to red if you are confident it is not in the word, or to set the letter to blue if you are confident it is in the word.</p>
            <p>Toggling letter colors is not required.</p>
